# pomodoro-timer-python

This is a pomodoro timer App using Tkinter, the standard GUI library for Python.

Pomodoro technique is a famous technique that helps people to time-manage and to get more stuff done productively.

This technique effectively utilizes the way the brain works, to take short breaks often and to work for 25 minutes at a time.

This helps us with information retention and also keeping up the motivation to do any task.



#### Steps involved in pomodoro technique:
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set timer to 25 minutes
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short 5 minute break
5. Repeat the steps 2 to 4 for four times
6. Take a 15-30 minute long break


This application is a timer with a tomato on it.

When you click start, it's going to tell you to work for 25 minutes. 

When the timer is up, it will pop to the very front of the screen and tell you to take a break.

So the first break for five minutes a check mark will be appeared on the screen for first pomodoro completed.

Once you are done with the break, then it is going to go back to work and it is going to continue until you reach the longer break or until you click reset to stop and reset the timer.
